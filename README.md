<h1>How i can modify it</h1>
<p> Change Package name. Do not increase or decrease min and target sdk version in build.gradel file.
because starting with Android 10+, apps cannot access external storage by default. Instead, they need to use the Storage Access Framework (SAF) to request access to specific files or folders.
 In Android 10+ the external storage access is restricted, and apps targeting Android 10 or higher can no longer request the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE and WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permissions.
